## Our project:

Final goal - The program manages a stock of apartments for sale.

The system will provide a wide range of functions to the user such as:
- Insert a new apartment to the stock.
- Delete an apartment from the stock.
- Show details of apartments by filterץ
- Show history of actions on the system.

The system writes the apartments details into a binary file and a text file.
When uploading the system it reads the details from the files.
